# Ubiquity.NET.Runtime.Utils
This library contains support functionality to aid in building a language parser or runtime,
including common implementation of a Read-Evaluate-Print Loop (REPL). Generally this is used
in conjunction with the Ubiquity.NET.Llvm library to provide custom DSL JIT support.

See the Kaleidoscope tutorial for details on how to use this library
