    /// <para>This is not, nor can it ever be a `ref struct` as such things are not usable in an array. Many LLVM APIs
    /// deal with arrays of handles which requires heap allocated location of the handle value not allowed by `ref struct`.
    /// This is an important performance distinction as an array of handles, once pinned, is castable to a pointer to the
    /// underlying native form. The structs are bit compatible with the underlying form. They are essentially a managed code
    /// variant on a type alias. They provide type specific insurance for an opaque native pointer.</para>
    ///  This handle is owned by it's container and therefore isn't disposable
    ///
    /// <note type="important">
    ///     Since the object this handle refers to is not owned by the App, the object is
    ///     destroyed whenever it's container is destroyed, which will invalidate this handle.
    ///     Use of this handle after the container is destroyed will produce undefined
    ///     behavior, including, and most likely, memory access violations.
