    /// <para>This is not, nor can it ever be a `ref struct` as such things are not usable in an array. Many LLVM APIs
    /// deal with arrays of handles which requires heap allocated location of the handle value not allowed by `ref struct`.
    /// This is an important performance distinction as an array of handles, once pinned, is castable to a pointer to the
    /// underlying native form. The structs are bit compatible with the underlying form. They are essentially a managed code
    /// variant on a type alias. They provide type specific insurance for an opaque native pointer.</para>
    /// <note type="important">
    ///   This is a "Disposable" struct to provide a standard mechanism for releasing the handle
    ///   AND to allow for performance in marshalling arrays of handles. (It's just an
    ///   <see cref="nint"/> under the hood.) This removes the need to perform any sort of marshaling
    ///   conversions whenever passed to a native API, and for EVERY entry in an array instead of just
    ///   fixing the array and passing a pointer. There are a LOT of APIs that take an array of handles
    ///   and this allows use with them in a significantly more performant fashion. Copying this struct,
    ///   which happens a LOT under the hood, will simply copy the underlying <see cref="nint"/> but NOT
    ///   it's disposed state. Consumers should use care in ONLY making a single call to Dispose().
    ///   Due to this trade-off it is an inherently dangerous structure and requires care to ensure the
    ///   correct usage.
