    /// support collide. Even the paid builds would struggle to build all of the LLVM targets for a given runtime
    /// into a single library. Even assuming it can, the result is so large that it isn't usable with standard
    /// package services like NuGet.org. So, the solution is that the library is built supporting no more than
    /// two targets. The native target for the runtime is ALWAYS supported and, optionally, one additional target
    /// is included. Additionally, the target library is built into it's own NuGet package with a single "meta"
    /// package for the runtime that references each of the targets. This keeps the packages small and the downloads
    /// limited to the targeted runtime.
