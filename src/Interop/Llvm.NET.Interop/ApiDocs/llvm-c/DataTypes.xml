;;     This file contains the Manually edited doc comments info that the
;;     generated code files refer to. This was originally cloned from the
;;     'GeneratedDocsFolder' and requires manual update and merging whenever
;;     the API surface changes. The generated XML is not committed to the repository
;;     but serves as a useful aid in building the docs for generated code files.
