    <Function name="LibLLVMOrcGetSymbolAddress">
        <summary>Extended method to get a symbol address from the OrcJit</summary>
        <param name="JITStack">OrcJit to get the symbol from</param>
        <param name="RetAddr">Symbol address</param>
        <param name="SymbolName">Name of the symbol to find</param>
        <param name="ExportedSymbolsOnly">flag to indicate if search includes only exported symbols</param>
        <returns>error information</returns>
        <remarks>
            This function differs from <see cref="LLVMOrcGetSymbolAddress"/> only in the inclusion of the
            <paramref name="ExportedSymbolsOnly"/> parameter. This is required when running on Windows
            based platforms as the object file created by the JIT doesn't have the functions marked as
            exported, so it won't see the symbol unless ExportedSymbolsOnly is <see langword="false"/>.
