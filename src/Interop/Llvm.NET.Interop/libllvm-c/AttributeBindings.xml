;; <usage>
;;     This file contains the bare bones skeleton doc comments info that the
;;     generated code files refer to. If the orginal source contained comments,
;;     those comments are generated here as the "remarks" element to aid in
;;     completing the docs. This always generated file is created with a .g.xml
;;     extension, however the generated C# code includes the form with the ".g"
;;     in the extension. This prevents the generation of this skeleton from
;;     overwriting any customized docs data. Any new entries need merging into
;;     the real version with all the manual edits.
