# LLVM ORC JIT v2 support

## Known issues
There is a [known bug](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/65641) with LLVM
JIT object creation. The default LLJIT exposed by the LLVM-C API library does NOT
use JitLink as recommended. Changing to support that, may alleviate the problem. But,
as of this build it can still happen. Experience has shown it only appears to hit for
a Release build with an attached debugger. So, it's a very small window of opportunity
to hit but when it does, it's a HARD crash.
