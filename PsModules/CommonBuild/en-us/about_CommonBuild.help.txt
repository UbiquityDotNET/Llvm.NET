LONG DESCRIPTION
    A module for common (Repo-independent) functionality of the Ubiquity.NET.* family of projects.
    This module contains build support scripts that are (ideally) platform agnostic and repository
    agnostic. (The platform agnosticism is a work in progress, there are several places where it
    does matter and those are currently implemented to detect Windows-X64 and error out if not.
    Eventually those should expand to support more/all runtimes)

EXAMPLES
    Examples of how to use the module or how the subject feature works in practice.
