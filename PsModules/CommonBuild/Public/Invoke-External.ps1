function Invoke-External($cmd)
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Invokes an external command with arguments converting any failure (non-zero return) into an exception

.PARAMETER cmd
    The external command to run. This may be a full path, relative path or just the cmd name (assuming it is
    executable from the current environment search paths). Any additional arguments are passed to the cmd
    as-is.

.DESCRIPTION
    This provides two core features:
    1) Platform neutral execution of an external command that might conflict with a built-in alias.
    2) Detection of success for an external command (as a non-zero return code) and throws an exception
        - This is the normal behavior for command line applications. If the app returns a non-zero value
          as a success code, then this script may not be used as it would consider that a failure.
