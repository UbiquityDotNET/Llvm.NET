<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Shows docs using the docfx built-in server

.PARAMETER buildInfo
   BuildInfo to use for current repo build. The hashtable provided for this must include the
   `DocsOutputPath` value for the path to use. This is normally set by a call to `Initialize-Environment`

.PARAMETER DocsPathToHost
    Path of docs to host. Default is the local build but any legit path is accepted.
    This is useful when downloading docs build artifacts to ensure they are built correctly.
