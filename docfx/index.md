# Ubiquity.NET
Ubiquity.NET family of libraries provides support for a number of scenarios but the primary focus is
AOT code generation of .NET for Embedded systems. We aren't quite there yet, but are rather close. In
the mean time this set of libraries provides the building blocks needed for creating a Domain Specific
Language (DSL) implementation including JIT execution. Several useful generalized librareis are also
included.

## The Libraries in this repository
(At least the ones generating docs at this point anyway! :grin:)
