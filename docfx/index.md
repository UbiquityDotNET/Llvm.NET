# Ubiquity.NET.Llvm
Ubiquity.NET.Llvm is a managed wrapper around an extended LLVM-C API including an Object Oriented model that closely matches 
the underlying LLVM internal object model. This allows for building code generation and other utilities
leveraging LLVM from .NET applications.

For more details see the full [API documentation](api/index.md)

## Guiding principles

  1. Mirror the underlying LLVM model as much as possible while 
  providing a well behaved .NET projection including:
     1. Class names and hierarchies
     2. Object identity and reference equality
     3. [Fluent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) APIs when plausible and appropriate
  2. Hide low-level interop details and the raw LLVM-C API.  
  The native model for LLVM is a C++ class hierarchy and not the LLVM-C API used for most
  language/runtime bindings. Ubiquity.NET.Llvm is designed to provide an OO model that faithfully reflects the
  underlying LLVM model while fitting naturally into .NET programming patterns.
  3. Leverage existing LLVM-C APIs underneath whenever possible
     1. Extend only when needed with custom wrappers
  4. FxCop/Code Analysis Clean

## Features
* LLVM Cross target code generation from .NET code
* JIT engine support for creating dynamic domain specific language
  runtimes with JIT support. (See [Kaleidoscope language tutorial](xref:Kaleidoscope-Overview) for more details)
* Ahead of time compilation with support for Link time optimization and debug information
* Object model that reflects the underlying LLVM classes
