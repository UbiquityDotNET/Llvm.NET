# Articles
This section provides articles and geenral concepts on using Llvm.NET. 

It is important to point out that the Llvm.NET documentation is not a substitue
for the official LLVM documentation itself. That is, the content here is focused on
using Lllvm.NET and how it maps to the underlying LLVM. The LLVM documentation is,
generally speaking, required reading to understand Llvm.NET. The topics here contain
links to the official LLVM documentation to help in further understanding the
functionality of the library.
