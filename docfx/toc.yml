# This is the top level TOC, it describes the entries along the horizontal top menu of all pages in this site
# NOTE: docfx is finicky and silent on the various syntax forms of links here (including whether they result
# in a link to something that even has a left nav!)
# href: <foldername>/ => resolves to a link to the FIRST element of the TOC file (or chain) that produces HTML [Includes left nav]
# href: <foldername>/index.md => or any other direct content link will link to that file; This is a more explicit form of the first form
# href: <foldername>/toc.yml => Accepted but broken; generates a link to "undefined" AND any links to the index.md from that folder have no left NAV
# Thus, this doc set always uses the more explicit second form
