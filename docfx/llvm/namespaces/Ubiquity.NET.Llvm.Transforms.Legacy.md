This namespace contains the wrappers for supporting the "legacy" pass management. This is NOT
normally used by applications as the new pass manager support is built into [Module](xref:Ubiquity.NET.Llvm.Module)
and [Function](xref:Ubiquity.NET.Llvm.Values.Function) via one of the overloads of
`TryRunPasses(...)`. Generally the legacy pass manager support is only used for final target
code generation and not exposed for LLVM-C consumption and therefore not of any real use.
