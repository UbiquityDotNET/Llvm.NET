# Ubiquity.NET.Llvm
Ubiquity.NET.Llvm is a managed wrapper around an extended LLVM-C API including an Object Oriented model that closely matches 
the underlying LLVM internal object model. This allows for building code generation, JIT and other utilities leveraging LLVM
from .NET applications.

## Guiding principles

  1. Mirror the underlying LLVM model as much as possible while 
  providing a well behaved .NET projection including:
     1. Class names and hierarchies
     2. Object identity and reference equality
     3. [Fluent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) APIs when plausible and appropriate
  2. Hide low-level interop details and the raw LLVM-C API.  
  The native model for LLVM is a C++ class hierarchy and not the LLVM-C API used for most
  language/runtime bindings. Ubiquity.NET.Llvm is designed to provide an OO model that faithfully reflects the
  underlying LLVM model while fitting naturally into .NET programming patterns.
  3. Leverage existing LLVM-C APIs underneath whenever possible
     1. Extend only when needed with custom wrappers
  4. FxCop/Code Analysis Clean

## Features
* LLVM Cross target code generation from .NET code
* JIT engine support for creating dynamic domain specific language
  runtimes with JIT support.
* Ahead of time compilation with support for Link time optimization and debug information
* Object model that reflects the underlying LLVM classes

## Breaking changes from prior versions
In Version 20.1.0 a number of issues were resolved using newer .NET as well as in the LLVM
design itself that allows for a fundamentally new implementation. While there isn't a LOT of
code that consumers have to change (See the samples and compare against older versions) there
are important factors to consider in the new library:
1) Ownership
    - The previous variants of the library did NOT generally consider ownership carefully. It
      routinely provided types that under some circumstances require disposal, and others did
      not (Alias). This caused problems for the interning of projected types as the behavior
      of the first instance interned was used. (Usually leading to leaks or strange crashes at
      obscure unrelated times that made testing extremely difficult [Worst case scenario, it
      works fine in all in-house testing but breaks in the field!).
3) No Interning of projected types
    - Projected types are no longer interned, this dramatically increases performance and
      reduces the complexity of maintenance of this library. Generally it should have little
      impact as anything that produces an alias where the type might in other cases require
      the owner to dispose it should now produce an interface that is not disposable. Anything
      the caller owns IS an IDisposable.
        - Move semantics are handled internally where the provided instance is invalidated but
          the Dispose remains a safe NOP. This helps prevent leaks or confusion when transfer is
          unable to complete due to an exception. The caller still owns the resource. Either way,
          Dispose() is called to clean it up, which is either a safe NOP, or an actual release of
          the native resource.
2) Assumption of Reference Equality
    1) In the new library there is NO guarantee of reference equality for reference types.
        - Such types MAY be value equal if they refer to the same underlying native instance.

### Ownership and IDisposable
When dealing with native interop the concept of ownership is of critical importance. The underlying
resources are NOT controlled by a Garbage collector, and therefore require care to avoid access violations
and other app crash scenarios. This library aims to make that much easier by using IDisposable for these
scenarios. It is ***HIGHLY** recommended to use the [IDisposableAnalyzers](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IDisposableAnalyzers/)
in ANY project that consumes this library. (It was/is used internally to find and fix issues across the
library that were tedious to identify otherwise).

#### Ownership transfer (move semantics)
Sometimes an API will transfer ownership to a containing type or native code in general. In C++ terminology
that is known as 'move semantics' and typically handled with `std::move()` but .NET and C# have no such
concept. To make life easier and keep usage of disposable types consistent, when a method follows the move
semantics it should be documented as such and, more importantly, it will set the value provided as invalid
BUT calling `Dispose()` is still a NOP. This keeps usage consistent even if ownership is transferred.
Attempting to use an instance after it is transferred will result in an `ObjectDisposedException`.

Example from [OrcV2VeryLazy](xref:orcjitv2-very-lazy) sample application
``` C#
// ownership of this Materialization Unit (MU) is "moved" to the JITDyLib in the
// call to Define. Applying a "using" ensures it is released even if an exception
// occurs that prevents completion of the transfer. When transfer completes the
// MU is marked as disposed but a call to Dispose() is a safe NOP. Thus, this handles
// all conditions consistently
using var fooMu = new CustomMaterializationUnit("FooMU", Materialize, fooSym);
jit.MainLib.Define(fooMu);
```

### Unowned references (alias)
For an unowned reference to an underlying resource an interface is defined such as [IModule](xref:Ubiquity.NET.Llvm.IModule).
When a property returns an interface only it is not Disposable and ownership remains with the source.
Care is required on the part of a consumer to not store that instance anywhere and treat it as if it was a
`ref struct` (That is, only held on the stack). While the GC is free to clean up such an instance at any time
this prevents attempts to use the interface after the containing object is destroyed.

### Equality
In prior releases of this library a complex scheme of interning projection wrappers was used to support
reference equality. When you had an instance of class 'foo' you could just compare it to any other using reference
equality. For any two that referred to the same native instance they'd be the same object. While this had convenience
for the user it had a multitude of hidden flaws. The biggest is the concept of ownership. [See discussion above]. If
objects are interned then you would end up with whatever instance was first created, ignoring the ownership completely.
If the first instance was an unowned alias, then it would leak as nothing owns it... If it was NOT an alias, then,
when retrieved from interning when an alias is needed to be the result, you could end up with premature disposal...
It was all confusing on whether you are supposed to call Dispose() or not. (Exact opposite of recommended best practice
for IDisposable).

Thus, this version of the library eliminates the confusion and complexity by use of objects that are disposable,
interfaces and a usage pattern that ensures Dispose() is idempotent and a NOP when already disposed. In the current
release no interning is performed, and instead wrapping types implement [`IEquatable<T>`](xref:System.IEquatable`1)
to allow value equality to compare the underlying native handle and resolve them as the same underlying instance or
not.
