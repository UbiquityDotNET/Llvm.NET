# Samples  
Ubiquity.NET.Llvm provides multiple samples to aid in understanding how to use the Ubiquity.NET.Llvm library.
These samples are designed and intended to illustrate some aspect(s) of using Ubiquity.NET.Llvm itself
and are not generally considered production quality. They serve to illustrate usage of some aspect with as
little extraneous overhead as possible. The Kaleidsocope examples all use a common runtime, which is not
necessary to understand usage of the Ubiquity.NET.Llvm library. Though they can serve as an example of how
to implement something similar.
