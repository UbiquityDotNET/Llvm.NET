# Ubiquity DOCFX template
This template adds support to the syntx highlighting provided by [HightlightJS](https://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported-languages.html).
The languages added are for ANTLR (Which seems bizarre it isn't already covered given the
esoteric nature of some of the supported languages...) and of course the `Kaleidoscope`
language, which was made up entirely for the purposes of LLVM tutorials. (No surprise that one
isn't supported)
