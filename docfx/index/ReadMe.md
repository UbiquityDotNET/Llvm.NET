# Docs Index
This folder contains the DocFx project for the top level index for this repo.
The top level index contains a general high level overview of the project as
well as links to the version specific full documentation. (e.g. this is
intentionally a small project that doesn't change except to include links
to newer versions of the documentation.) Older documentation is NOT wiped
out by new versions. (For final releases anyway, pre-release docs overwrite
any previous pre-releases to keep the number of docs versions to a sane level.
