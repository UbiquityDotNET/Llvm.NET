DocFX is used to generate the documentation for this library. There is confusion on
what the statictoc template means and requires. It is ***LITERALLY*** that the
Table of Contents (TOC) is staticly generated. So that the entire site is servable
from file path. This ***DOES NOT*** mean that the default+modern template is
unusable for hosted static site scenarios like 'gh-pages' in GitHub. It only means
that the TOC support will ***require*** a hosted site to provide the contents needed
by the generated TOC client side scripting. That's it. Don't fear the built-in
templates (Despite the lack of decent docs explaining the details [Yeah, this
project previously fell into those gaps and even constructed a custom template to
deal with it... Sigh, what a waste of time... :facepalm: ])

## Changes Over Time
DocFX has obsoleted the `docfxconsole` NuGet pacakge that was used to run docfx for
a project via MSBUILD. Instead it focused on a .NET tool to do it all via the
command line. Ultimately the docfx.json serves as the "project" file for the
different site builds. The PowerShell script `Build-Docs.ps1` was updated to use
the new tool directly. Using that script should have little or no impact on the
overall flow.

## Files used by the docs generation
There are a lot of files used to generate the docs and the concept of a Table of
Contents (TOC) gets confusing fast when using docfx. So this tries to explain them
all.

### .gitignore
This marks the files that are generated as ignored for GIT operations (Don't
include generated sources in the repo - the automated build will generate them).
Some specific files are excluded from this but most of the api-* folders are
ignored.

### docfx.json
This file serves as the "project" file for docs generation. Sadly, docfx has
deprecated old `docfxconsole` that supported creation of a csproj project file to
generate the docs from. So this file serves as the only equivalent of a project
file. Unfortunately, it is in JSON format and unlike any other project is unusable
directly in an IDE as they don't understand the format of such a thing.

### favicon.ico
This provides the standard web brower icon for the site as a whole.

### index.md
Markdown for the index (Home) of this site.

### toc.yml
YAML file containing the links for the Table of contents for the SITE as a whole
(across all child pages/folders). This is for the TOP row navigation on the site.
(It has NOTHING to do with the left navigation for any given sub folder, other than
having the same name, confusingly.)

>NOTE
> The TOC.YML file format used in these topics is DIFFERENT from what is auto
> generated.

### Folders
There are a few folders containing input for the site generation.

#### api-*
These folders contain the Generated contents for each project as (YAML) metadata
files parsed and generated from the source.

##### api-*/Index.md
This contains the main landing page for a given library it has the top bar
navigation from [toc.yml](#tocyml) AND the left navigation from the generated
[toc.yml](#generated-left-nav-tocyml) for this API library. (Confusingly, a file
with the same name, but a completely differnt purpose!)

#### Generated left nav TOC.YML
This version of the overloaded toc.yml file name is used to produce the left
navigation for an API surface. This is generated from the source files and normally
contains the set of namespaces, types, enums etc... Each library project generates
it's own version of this file. Since this is generated it is listed in the
[.gitignore](#gitignore) file.

#### Library Content
These folders (named after the `*` portion of the [api-*](#api-*) folder names
contains manually written additional files, articles, samples etc... related to a
given library.
