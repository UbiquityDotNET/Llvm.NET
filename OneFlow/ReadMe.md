# GIT OneFlow support scripts
The scripts in this folder are used for release and feature branch management.
This repository follows the [OneFlow](https://www.endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow#develop-finishing-a-release-branch)
model and workflow. With one active long term branch 'develop'. (The master
branch is present and long term but is not active, it only points to the latest
official release (including preview releases) of the project. This is a convenience
to allow getting the latests released source quickly. Generally the scripts used here
are only for release managers with direct push permissions to the repository and are
not generally required for most contributors.
