<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Publishes the current branch state as an official release tag

.DESCRIPTION
    This function ensures that no changes exist in the local repository so that only the tag is pushed.
    Pushing a release tag should trigger GitHub actions that starts the official build via a GitHub action
    or other such automated build processes. These, normally, also include publication of the resulting
    binaries as appropriate. This function only pushes the tag, the rest is up to the back-end configuration
    of the repository.

# Release tags must only be pushed from a repository with the official GitHub repository as the origin remote.
# This ensures that the links to source in the generated docs will have the correct URLs
# (e.g. docs pushed to the official repository MUST not have links to source in some private fork)
