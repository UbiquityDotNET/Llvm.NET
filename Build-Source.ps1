<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Builds just the source code to produce the binaries and NuGet packages for the Ubiquity.NET.Llvm libraries

.PARAMETER Configuration
    This sets the build configuration to use, default is "Release" though for inner loop development this may be set to "Debug"

.PARAMETER FullInit
    Performs a full initialization. A full initialization includes forcing a re-capture of the time stamp for local builds
    as well as writes details of the initialization to the information and verbose streams.

.PARAMETER ForceClean
    Forces a complete clean (Recursive delete of the build output)

    # data for the error. Without this, only the error message is retained and the location information is
    # Line 1, Column 1, of the outer most script file, which is, of course, completely useless.
