<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Builds the docs for this repository

.PARAMETER Configuration
    This sets the build configuration to use, default is "Release" though for inner loop development this may be set to "Debug"

.PARAMETER AllowVsPreReleases
    Switch to enable use of Visual Studio Pre-Release versions. This is NEVER enabled for official production builds, however it is
    useful when adding support for new versions during the pre-release stages.

.PARAMETER FullInit
    Performs a full initialization. A full initialization includes forcing a re-capture of the time stamp for local builds
    as well as writes details of the initialization to the information and verbose streams.

.PARAMETER NoClone
    Skip cloning of the docs repository. Useful for inner loop development where you only do the clone once when iterating on
    doc updates.

.PARAMETER ShowDocs
    Show the docs via `docfx serve --open-browser ...`. This option is useful for inner loop development of the docs as it allows
    opening a browser on the newly created docs for testing/checking the contents are produced correctly.

.PARAMETER ServeDocs
    Skips the docs build and implies ShowDocs to serve the current docs in the repo. This is useful after a previous
    Build-All or similar validation on a local machine as that will also build the docs but won't show/serve them.
